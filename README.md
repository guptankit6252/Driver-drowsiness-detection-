# Driver-drowsiness-detection-
Driver Drowsiness System intermediate-level Python project. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy. The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents I build a system using Python, OpenCV and Arduino which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy. Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
# Command to run the program
python3 detect.py --shape-predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat --alarm alarm.wav --webcam 0
